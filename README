Arduino Wiring:

Emitter
Power Out Ground → (short pin)  TSAL6200 (long pin) → 100ohm Resistor → Arduino Digital 3

Receiver
Arduino Digital 11 → (left pin, facing receiver)  TSOP4138
Power Out Ground → (center pin) TSOP4138
Power Out Ground → 10uF Capacitor → (right pin, facing receiver) TSOP4138
Power Out 5v → 100ohm Resistor → (right pin, facing receiver) TSOP4138

Arduino Programming:

1) Put “IRremote” in .../arduino-18/libraries/
2) Launch the Arduino IDE
3) Open Arduino/IRrelay/IRrelay.pde
4) Select the proper Arduino USB serial port 
5) Select Arduino Duemilanove (Or appropriate)
6) Upload
